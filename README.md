# current-weather-info
program that uses tkinter, pandas, and weather api
allows user to enter zip code in a gui to find out current weather
zip code verification data comes from https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/zip-code-database/

potential future improvements:
1) instead of having weather information show up on informational message box, have it display on the main window with a corresponding graphic
2) allow user to find out future weather information by entering future date and time (requires paid weather api service)
3) allows user to find out weather data beyond the us
